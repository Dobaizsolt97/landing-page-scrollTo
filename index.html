            The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands
            of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the

            She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
            made herself on the way. When she reached the first hills of the
            Italic Mountains, she had a last view back on the skyline of her
            hometown Bookmarksgrove, the headline of Alphabet Village and the
            subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rethoric question
            ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
            copy. The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from
            it would have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that
            was left from its origin would be the word "and" and the Little
            Blind Text should turn around and return to its own, safe country.
            But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take
            long until a few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk
            with Longe and Parole and dragged her into their agency, where they
            abused her for their projects again and again.
